CoMetGeNe trail finding (CoMetGeNe.py, CoMetGeNe_launcher.py) and trail grouping
(grouping.py) require this directory in order to save the following five binary
files:

* grouping_reaction_sets.pickle               (created by grouping.py)
* grouping_r_numbers.pickle                   (created by grouping.py)
* grouping_species_object.pickle              (created by grouping.py)
* kegg_ec_info.pickle         (created by CoMetGeNe.py or CoMetGeNe_launcher.py)
* kegg_genome_info.pickle     (created by CoMetGeNe.py or CoMetGeNe_launcher.py)
    
These files are not human-readable, being created with the Python cPickle module 
that allows 'dumping' the contents of a data structure to a binary file in order
to speed up subsequent executions.
    
    
Files created by CoMetGeNe.py or CoMetGeNe_launcher.py:

    * kegg_ec_info.pickle contains EC number information retrieved from
      http://rest.kegg.jp/link/reaction/enzyme. It associates EC numbers to 
      R numbers (KEGG reaction identifiers). These associations are needed for
      CoMetGeNe output files.
      
    * kegg_genome_info.pickle contains genomic information for every species 
      analyzed. For any given species on which CoMetGeNe is executed, protein-
      coding genes are stored in this file with their identifier, chromosome,
      chromosome strand, and position on the chromosomal strand.

      
Files created by grouping.py:

    * grouping_reaction_sets.pickle contains CoMetGeNe trails in the form of 
      reaction sets.
    
    * grouping_r_numbers.pickle contains associations between R numbers, 
      species, pathways, and gene identifiers of the given species.
    
    * grouping_species_object.pickle contains the order of genes on chromosomes
      for every species analyzed.

           Important notice regarding trail grouping (grouping.py)
         
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If trail grouping has been performed at least once, the grouping_*.pickle files
are created. When performing trail grouping on a new dataset, a message is 
displayed on stderr to inform you that the old grouping_*.pickle files do not 
contain the required information. In this case, you can either delete or rename
the old grouping_*.pickle files.

If trail grouping still cannot be performed, it is because the 
kegg_genome_info.pickle file does not contain (all) the new species. This can
happen if you accidentally deleted this file after running CoMetGeNe.py or 
CoMetGeNe_launcher.py. In this case, the file kegg_genome_info.pickle needs to
be recreated. In order to do so, re-run CoMetGeNe.py or CoMetGeNe_launcher.py.
