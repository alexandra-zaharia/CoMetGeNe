Changes in CoMetGeNe version 1.2
================================================================================

* The number of threads on which CoMetGeNe is ran is now configuable in 
  CoMetGeNe_launcher.py through the variable n_thr_cometgene (by default, it is
  initialized to the maximum number of available threads).


================================================================================
Changes in CoMetGeNe version 1.1
================================================================================

* Enzyme-coding information is retrieved from KEGG (may be used for statistics).
* Fixed gene retrieval bug where a gene would not be retrieved from KEGG if it
  was the only gene in a download batch.
* Circular chromosomes are now handled.
* Added positional information checks for genes. If a CDS has no position or has
  an invalid position, the CDS in question is ignored (as it is not possible to
  know what rank it has on a given chromosome).
* Genomic information is now pickled incrementally (as soon as genomic 
  information has been downloaded for a given species). This is accomplished by
  using a multiprocessing lock by threads wanting to write in the pickle file.
* CoMetGeNe v1.1 is now compatible with NetworkX 2.2. Fixes include rewriting 
  NetworkX 1.10 and 1.11 'edge' and 'node' attributes such that they are also 
  understood by NetworkX 2.2, and creating new Graph or DiGraph objects for 
  induced subgraphs (in NetworkX 1.10 and 1.11, these subgraphs could be 
  edited, whereas in 2.2 they are frozen).
